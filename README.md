<b>About:</b>

The MERN stack is a collection of great tools—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node—that provide a strong base for a developer to build easily maintainable web applications. With each of them a JavaScript or JavaScript-based technology, having a shared programming language means it takes less time to develop web applications.

This Learning Path begins with explaining JavaScript concepts such as data types, DOM elements, event listeners, arrow functions, and design patterns. Next, you will focus on building a social network application using Node.js, Express, React, Redux and MongoDB along with ES6+. Thereafter, you will be developing 2 projects. In the first project, you will build an application where content creators can register and jot down and manage ideas for future videos. This application explains everything about Express routing, middleware, templates, Mongoose, and more. In the second project, you will build an application for creating public and private stories where you will use Google OAuth 2.0 strategy for authentication and create dashboards for users to manage their stories. Finally, you will deploy this application on Heroku and add a domain name. This entire learning path is accomplished with the help of exercises and multiple course projects - because it isn't just about seeing code, it's about using and practicing it!

By the end of this Learning Path, you will gain practical and clear hands-on experience to begin building and deploying your own full-stack MERN web applications.
